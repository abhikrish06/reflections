How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area holds the files to be committed to the git repo and it can have some or all of the untracked files.
working directory on the other hand keeps both tracked and untracked files.
It helps in separating commits.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created. It is needed to track the versions/history of files that are present in the directory. Also, we get a Initial Commit message on doing git status.
